 This project is for building predictive models (ANN, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM) to classify
 sleep disorder presence. Feature engineering and exploratory data analysis are conducted, F1-score and accuracy are used to evaluate the models.

 All the codes and the paper can be found in the repository.
